6. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.

a. Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described below connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. You may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see the software documentation. BY USING THESE FEATURES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.

·        Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.

·        Windows Update Feature. You may connect new hardware to the device where you installed the software. Your device may not have the drivers needed to communicate with that hardware. If so, the update feature of the software can obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and install it on your device. You can switch off this update feature.

·        Web Content Features. Features in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and provide it to you. To provide the content, these features send to Microsoft the type of operating system, name and version of the software you are using, type of browser and language code of the device where you installed the software. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online assistance and Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web content features.

·        Digital Certificates. The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information. The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists. These security features operate only when you use the Internet.

·        Auto Root Update. The Auto Root Update feature updates the list of trusted certificate authorities. You can switch off the Auto Root Update feature.

·        Windows Media Digital Rights Management. Content owners use Windows Media digital rights management technology (WMDRM) to protect their intellectual property, including copyrights. This software and third party software use WMDRM to play and copy WMDRM-protected content. If the software fails to protect the content, content owners may ask Microsoft to revoke the software’s ability to use WMDRM to play or copy protected content. Revocation does not affect other content. When you download licenses for protected content, you agree that Microsoft may include a revocation list with the licenses. Content owners may require you to upgrade WMDRM to access their content. Microsoft software that includes WMDRM will ask for your consent prior to the upgrade. If you decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade. You may switch off WMDRM features that access the Internet. When these features are off, you can still play content for which you have a valid license.

·        Windows Media Player. When you use Windows Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for

·        compatible online music services in your region;

·        new versions of the player; and

·        codecs if your device does not have the correct ones for playing content.

·        You can switch off this last feature. For more information, go to  www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/mp10/privac y.aspx.

·        Windows Rights Management Services. The software contains a feature that allows you to create content that cannot be printed, copied or sent to others without your permission. You must connect to Microsoft to use this feature for the first time. Once a year, you must re-connect to Microsoft to update it. For more information, go to www.microsoft.com/WINDOWS/RM/PRIVACY. You may choose not to use this feature.

b. Misuse of Internet-based Services. You may not use these services in any way that could harm them or impair anyone else’s use of them. You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.

7. DATA STORAGE TECHNOLOGY. The 32-bit version of Windows server software includes data storage technology called Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine for Windows. Components of the server software use this technology to store data. You may not otherwise use or access this technology under this agreement.

8. FEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.

9. MICROSOFT WINDOWS SOFTWARE. The software contains the Microsoft .NET Framework and Microsoft Data Access Component software. This software is part of Windows. The license terms for Windows apply to your use of the .NET Framework and Microsoft Data Access Component software.

10. BENCHMARK TESTING.

·        repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses; or

·        Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

 *****************************************************************************************************

LIMITED WARRANTY

A. LIMITED WARRANTY. If you follow the instructions, the software will perform substantially as described in the Microsoft materials that you receive in or with the software.

B. TERM OF WARRANTY; WARRANTY RECIPIENT; LENGTH OF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES. The limited warranty covers the software for one year after acquired by the first user. If you receive supplements, updates, or replacement software during that year, they will be covered for the remainder of the warranty or 30 days, whichever is longer. If the first user transfers the software, the remainder of the warranty will apply to the recipient.

To the extent permitted by law, any implied warranties, guarantees or conditions last only during the term of the limited warranty.  Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so these limitations may not apply to you. They also might not apply to you because some countries may not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty, guarantee or condition lasts.

C. EXCLUSIONS FROM WARRANTY. This warranty does not cover problems caused by your acts (or failures to act), the acts of others, or events beyond Microsoft’s reasonable control.

D. REMEDY FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. Microsoft will repair or replace the software at no charge. If Microsoft cannot repair or replace it, Microsoft will refund the amount shown on your receipt for the software. It will also repair or replace supplements, updates and replacement software at no charge. If Microsoft cannot repair or replace them, it will refund the amount you paid for them, if any. You must uninstall the software and return any media and other associated materials to Microsoft with proof of purchase to obtain a refund. These are your only remedies for breach of the limited warranty.

E. CONSUMER RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws, which this agreement cannot change.

F. WARRANTY PROCEDURES. You need proof of purchase for warranty service.

Where allowed by your local laws, Microsoft excludes implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. If your local laws give you any implied warranties, guarantees or conditions, despite this exclusion, your remedies are described in the Remedy for Breach of Warranty clause above, to the extent permitted by your local laws.

H. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. The Limitation on and Exclusion of Damages clause above applies to breaches of this limited warranty.

Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.

Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.

GARANTIE LIMITÉE

A. GARANTIE LIMITÉE. Si vous suivez les instructions, le logiciel fonctionnera dans son ensemble comme il est décrit dans la documentation de Microsoft reçue avec ou dans le logiciel.

B. DURÉE DE LA GARANTIE ; BÉNÉFICIAIRE DE LA GARANTIE ; DURÉE DE TOUTE GARANTIE IMPLICITE. La garantie limitée couvre le logiciel pendant un an après son acquisition par le premier utilisateur. Si vous recevez des compléments, des mises à jour ou un logiciel de remplacement au cours de cette année, ils seront couverts par la garantie pendant la durée restante ou pendant 30 jours, la période la plus longue étant retenue. Si le premier utilisateur transfère le logiciel, la durée restante de la garantie s’applique au destinataire.

Dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur, toute garantie ou condition implicite dont vous bénéficiez prendra fin au terme de la garantie limitée. Certains États n’autorisent pas les limitations portant sur la durée d’une garantie implicite, de sorte que les limitations ci-dessus peuvent ne pas vous être applicables. Elles peuvent également ne pas vous être applicables, car certains pays n’autorisent pas les limitations portant sur la durée d’une garantie ou condition implicite.

C. EXCLUSIONS DE LA GARANTIE. Cette garantie ne couvre pas les problèmes engendrés par vos propres actes (ou absences d’actes), ceux de tiers ou tout autre événement indépendant de la volonté de Microsoft.

D. RECOURS DANS LE CADRE DE LA VIOLATION DE GARANTIE. Nous nous engageons à réparer ou à remplacer le logiciel gratuitement. Si nous ne pouvons pas le réparer ni le remplacer, nous rembourserons le montant que vous avez payé pour le logiciel figurant sur le reçu. Nous nous engageons à réparer ou à remplacer les compléments, les mises à jour et le logiciel de remplacement gratuitement. Si nous ne pouvons pas les réparer ni les remplacer, nous rembourserons le montant que vous avez payé pour ces composants, le cas échéant. Vous devez désinstaller le logiciel et le renvoyer à Microsoft avec une preuve d’achat pour vous faire rembourser. Ces recours sont les seuls dont vous disposez dans le cadre de la violation de garantie limitée.

E. DROITS DES CONSOMMATEURS NON AFFECTÉS. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits des consommateurs supplémentaires dans le cadre du droit local, que ce contrat ne peut modifier.

F. PROCÉDURES RELATIVES AUX RÉCLAMATIONS DANS LE CADRE DE LA GARANTIE. Vous devrez fournir une preuve d’achat pour obtenir de l’aide en matière de garantie.

2. Europe, Moyen-Orient et Afrique. Si vous avez acquis le logiciel en Europe, au Moyen-Orient ou en Afrique, Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited offre cette garantie limitée. Pour faire une réclamation au titre de cette garantie, vous devez vous mettre en rapport avec

·        Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, Customer Care Centre, Atrium Building Block B, Carmanhall Road, Sandyford Industrial Estate, Dublin 18, Irlande ; ou

·        votre filiale nationale de Microsoft (visitez le site www.microsoft.com/worldwide).

3. En dehors des États-Unis, du Canada, de l’Europe, du Moyen- Orient et de l’Afrique. Si vous avez acquis le logiciel en dehors des États-Unis, du Canada, de l’Europe, du Moyen-Orient et de l’Afrique, mettez-vous en rapport avec votre filiale nationale de Microsoft (visitez le site www.microsoft.com/worldwide).

G. AUCUNE AUTRE GARANTIE. La garantie limitée est la seule garantie directe de Microsoft. Nous n’accordons aucune autre garantie ou condition expresse. Dans toute la mesure permise par le droit local, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues. Si le droit local vous accorde des garanties ou conditions implicites, nonobstant la présente exclusion, les recours dont vous disposez sont ceux présentés dans la clause de recours dans le cadre de la violation de garantie ci-dessus, dans la limite autorisée par le droit local.

H. LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ DANS LE CADRE DE LA VIOLATION DE GARANTIE. La clause de limitation des dommages-intérêts et exclusion de responsabilité ci-dessous s’applique aux violations de cette garantie limitée.

La présente garantie vous confère des droits légaux spécifiques et vous pouvez également bénéficier d’autres droits qui varient d’un État à l’autre. Vous pouvez également bénéficier d’autres droits qui varient d’un pays à l’autre.

LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur du montant que vous avez payé pour le logiciel. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.

Cette limitation concerne

·        toute affaire liée au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers ; et

·        les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie ou condition, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.

Elle s’applique également, même si

·        la réparation, le remplacement ou le remboursement du logiciel ne compense pas intégralement toute perte subie ; ou

·        Microsoft connaissait l’éventualité d’un tel dommage.

Certains États n’autorisent pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects ou accessoires, de sorte que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus peut ne pas vous être applicable. Elles peuvent également ne pas vous être applicables, car votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit.

EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre État ou pays. Vous pourriez également avoir des droits à l’égard de la partie de qui vous avez acquis de logiciel. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre État ou pays si celles ci ne le permettent pas.

            anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

            claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

        It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

    PRODUCT KEYS.  The software requires a key to install or access it. You are responsible for the use of keys assigned to you. You should not share the keys with third parties.

    SQL SERVER BENCHMARK TESTING.  You must obtain Microsoft's prior written approval to disclose to a third party the results of any benchmark test of the SQL Server software that accompanies this software.

    MICROSOFT .NET FRAMEWORK BENCHMARK TESTING.  The software includes the .NET Framework component of the Windows operating systems (".NET Component"). You may conduct internal benchmark testing of the .NET Component. You may disclose the results of any benchmark test of the .NET Component, provided that you comply with the following terms:
        you must disclose all the information necessary for replication of the tests, including complete and accurate details of your benchmark testing methodology, the test scripts/cases, tuning parameters applied, hardware and software platforms tested, the name and version number of any third party testing tool used to conduct the testing, and complete source code for the benchmark suite/harness that is developed by or for you and used to test both the .NET Component and the competing implementation(s);
        you must disclose the date (s) that you conducted the benchmark tests, along with specific version information for all Microsoft software products tested, including the .NET Component;
        your benchmark testing was performed using all performance tuning and best practice guidance set forth in the product documentation and/or on Microsoft's support web sites, and uses the latest updates, patches and fixes available for the .NET Component and the relevant Microsoft operating system;
        it shall be sufficient if you make the disclosures provided for above at a publicly available location such as a website, so long as every public disclosure of the results of your benchmark test expressly identifies the public site containing all required disclosures; and
        nothing in this provision shall be deemed to waive any other right that you may have to conduct benchmark testing.
    The foregoing obligations shall not apply to your disclosure of the results of any customized benchmark test of the .NET Component, whereby such disclosure is made under confidentiality in conjunction with a bid request by a prospective customer, such customer's application(s) are specifically tested and the results are only disclosed to such specific customer. Notwithstanding any other agreement you may have with Microsoft, if you disclose such benchmark test results, Microsoft shall have the right to disclose the results of benchmark tests it conducts of your products that compete with the .NET Component, provided it complies with the same conditions above.

    ACADEMIC EDITION SOFTWARE.  You must be a "Qualified Educational User" to use software marked as "Academic Edition" or "AE." If you do not know whether you are a Qualified Educational User, visit www.microsoft.com/education or contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country.

    UPGRADE.  If this software is marked as an upgrade version, you may use it only if you have a license to use the software eligible for upgrade. If you upgrade, this software takes the place of the earlier version, and this agreement takes the place of the agreement for that earlier version. You may use the earlier version only as permitted in the Downgrade clause below.

    DOWNGRADE.  You may install and use this version and an earlier version of the software at the same time. This agreement applies to your use of the earlier version. If the earlier version includes different components, any terms for those components in the agreement that comes with the earlier version apply to your use of them. Microsoft is not obligated to supply earlier versions to you.

    TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY.  The first user of the software may transfer it, and this agreement, directly to a third party. Before the transfer, that party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software. The first user must uninstall the software before transferring it separately from the device. The first user may not retain any copies.

    EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.

    SUPPORT SERVICES.  Microsoft provides support services for the software as described at www.support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx.

    ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement (including the warranty below), and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

    APPLICABLE LAW.

        United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

        Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.

    LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country.

This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.

        claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if

        repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses; or

        Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.

    Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

LIMITED WARRANTY

    LIMITED WARRANTY.  If you follow the instructions, the software will perform substantially as described in the Microsoft materials that you receive in or with the software.

3. Responsibilities

    3.1. Distribution of Source Form

    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.
    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

    If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

        such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

        You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

    You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
    3.4. Notices

    You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
    3.5. Application of Additional Terms

    You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
5. Termination

    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
8. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
9. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
10. Versions of the License

    10.1. New Versions

    Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
    10.2. Effect of New Versions

    You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
    10.3. Modified Versions

    If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

    If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

You may use these Utilities only to debug your programs you've developed with the software. You must delete all the Utilities installed onto a machine within the earlier of
            when you have finished debugging your program; or
            thirty (30) days after installation of the Utilities onto that machine.

        Distributable Code.  The software contains code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.

            Right to Use and Distribute.  The code and text files listed below are "Distributable Code."

                REDIST.TXT Files.  You may copy and distribute the object code form of code listed in REDIST.TXT files, plus any files listed on the REDIST list located at: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=100327&clcid=0x409.

                Sample Code.  You may modify, copy, and distribute the source and object code form of code marked as "sample."

                Microsoft Merge Modules.  You may copy and distribute the unmodified output of Microsoft Merge Modules.

                MFCs, ATLs and CRTs.  You may modify the source code form of Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFCs), Active Template Libraries (ATLs), and C runtimes (CRTs) to design, develop and test your programs, and copy and distribute the object code form of your modified files under a new name.

                Image Library.  You may copy and distribute images and animations in the Image Library as described in the software documentation. You may also modify that content. If you modify the content, it must be for use that is consistent with the permitted use of the unmodified content.

                Third Party Distribution.  You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.

            Distribution Requirements.  For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must

                add significant primary functionality to it in your programs;

                for any Distributable Code having a filename extension of .lib, distribute only the results of running such Distributable Code through a linker with your program;

                distribute Distributable Code included in a setup program only as part of that setup program without modification;

                require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement;

                display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and

                indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs.

            Distribution Restrictions.  You may not

                alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;

                use Microsoft's trademarks in your programs' names or in a way that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;

                distribute Distributable Code to run on a platform other than Microsoft operating systems, run-time technologies or application platforms;

                include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or

                modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that

                    the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or

                    others have the right to modify it.

    INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.  Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.

        Consent for Internet-Based Services.  The software features described below connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. BY USING THESE FEATURES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.

        Computer Information.  The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.
            Windows Update Feature.  You may connect new hardware to the device where you installed the software. Your device may not have the drivers needed to communicate with that hardware. If so, the update feature of the software can obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and install it on your device. You can switch off this update feature.

            Web Content Features.  Features in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and provide it to you. To provide the content, these features send to Microsoft the type of operating system, name and version of the software you are using, type of browser and language code of the device where you installed the software. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online assistance and Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web content features.

            Real Simple Syndication ("RSS") Feed.  This software start page contains updated content that is supplied by means of an RSS feed online from Microsoft.

        Misuse of Internet-based Services.  You may not use these services in any way that could harm them or impair anyone else's use of them. You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.

    TRIAL EDITION SOFTWARE TERMS.  The following terms apply to the Trial Edition software even if there are terms to the contrary in other parts of this agreement:

        TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE.  If the version of the software is a Trial Edition, the software will stop running ninety days after you install it. You will receive notice before it stops running. You may not be able to access data used with the software when it stops running.

        DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  THE TRIAL EDITION SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

        LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.  FOR THE TRIAL EDITION SOFTWARE, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

        This limitation applies to

            anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

            claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

        It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

    PRODUCT KEYS.  The software requires a key to install or access it. You are responsible for the use of keys assigned to you. You should not share the keys with third parties.

    SQL SERVER BENCHMARK TESTING.  You must obtain Microsoft's prior written approval to disclose to a third party the results of any benchmark test of the SQL Server software that accompanies this software.

    .NET FRAMEWORK SOFTWARE.  The software contains Microsoft .NET Framework software. This software is part of Windows. The license terms for Windows apply to your use of the .NET Framework software.

    MICROSOFT .NET FRAMEWORK BENCHMARK TESTING.  The software includes the .NET Framework component of the Windows operating systems (".NET Component"). You may conduct internal benchmark testing of the .NET Component. You may disclose the results of any benchmark test of the .NET Component, provided that you comply with the following terms:
        you must disclose all the information necessary for replication of the tests, including complete and accurate details of your benchmark testing methodology, the test scripts/cases, tuning parameters applied, hardware and software platforms tested, the name and version number of any third party testing tool used to conduct the testing, and complete source code for the benchmark suite/harness that is developed by or for you and used to test both the .NET Component and the competing implementation(s);
        you must disclose the date (s) that you conducted the benchmark tests, along with specific version information for all Microsoft software products tested, including the .NET Component;
        your benchmark testing was performed using all performance tuning and best practice guidance set forth in the product documentation and/or on Microsoft's support web sites, and uses the latest updates, patches and fixes available for the .NET Component and the relevant Microsoft operating system;
        it shall be sufficient if you make the disclosures provided for above at a publicly available location such as a website, so long as every public disclosure of the results of your benchmark test expressly identifies the public site containing all required disclosures; and
        nothing in this provision shall be deemed to waive any other right that you may have to conduct benchmark testing.
    The foregoing obligations shall not apply to your disclosure of the results of any customized benchmark test of the .NET Component, whereby such disclosure is made under confidentiality in conjunction with a bid request by a prospective customer, such customer's application(s) are specifically tested and the results are only disclosed to such specific customer. Notwithstanding any other agreement you may have with Microsoft, if you disclose such benchmark test results, Microsoft shall have the right to disclose the results of benchmark tests it conducts of your products that compete with the .NET Component, provided it complies with the same conditions above.

    SCOPE OF LICENSE.  The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. For more information, see www.microsoft.com/licensing/userights. You may not

        work around any technical limitations in the software;

        reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;

        make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;

        publish the software for others to copy;

        rent, lease or lend the software; or

        use the software for commercial software hosting services.

        You may only use the Windows Mobile components located in the "\Program Files\Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK R2\" directory to create programs that run on Windows Mobile 5.0 software for Pocket PC or Windows Mobile 5.0 software for the Smartphone.

        Program Application and Driver Limitations.  You may not use or include any of the Windows Mobile components located in the "\Program Files\Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK R2\" directory, nor any components thereof, in the development of any program application, device or system in which a malfunction would result in a foreseeable risk of personal injury, death or severe physical or environmental damage.

    BACKUP COPY.  You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it only to reinstall the software.

    DOCUMENTATION.  Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes.

    NOT FOR RESALE SOFTWARE.  You may not sell software marked as "NFR" or "Not for Resale."

    ACADEMIC EDITION SOFTWARE.  You must be a "Qualified Educational User" to use software marked as "Academic Edition" or "AE." If you do not know whether you are a Qualified Educational User, visit www.microsoft.com/education or contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country.

    UPGRADE.  If this software is marked as an upgrade version, you may use it only if you have a license to use the software eligible for upgrade. If you upgrade, this software takes the place of the earlier version, and this agreement takes the place of the agreement for that earlier version. You may use the earlier version only as permitted in the Downgrade clause below.

    DOWNGRADE.  You may install and use this version and an earlier version of the software at the same time. This agreement applies to your use of the earlier version. If the earlier version includes different components, any terms for those components in the agreement that comes with the earlier version apply to your use of them. Microsoft is not obligated to supply earlier versions to you.

    TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY.  The first user of the software may transfer it, and this agreement, directly to a third party. Before the transfer, that party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software. The first user must uninstall the software before transferring it separately from the device. The first user may not retain any copies.

    EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.

    SUPPORT SERVICES.  Microsoft provides support services for the software as described at www.support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx.

    ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement (including the warranty below), and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

    APPLICABLE LAW.

        United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

        Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.

    LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.

    LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES.  YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

    This limitation applies to

        anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

        claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if

        repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses; or

        Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.

    Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.



**************************************************************************************

LIMITED WARRANTY

    LIMITED WARRANTY.  If you follow the instructions, the software will perform substantially as described in the Microsoft materials that you receive in or with the software.

    TERM OF WARRANTY; WARRANTY RECIPIENT; LENGTH OF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES.   THE LIMITED WARRANTY COVERS THE SOFTWARE FOR ONE YEAR AFTER ACQUIRED BY THE FIRST USER. IF YOU RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTS, UPDATES, OR REPLACEMENT SOFTWARE DURING THAT YEAR, THEY WILL BE COVERED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WARRANTY OR 30 DAYS, WHICHEVER IS LONGER. If the first user transfers the software, the remainder of the warranty will apply to the recipient.

    TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS LAST ONLY DURING THE TERM OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY. Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so these limitations may not apply to you. They also might not apply to you because some countries may not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty, guarantee or condition lasts.

    EXCLUSIONS FROM WARRANTY.  This warranty does not cover problems caused by your acts (or failures to act), the acts of others, or events beyond Microsoft's reasonable control.

    REMEDY FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY.  MICROSOFT WILL REPAIR OR REPLACE THE SOFTWARE AT NO CHARGE. IF MICROSOFT CANNOT REPAIR OR REPLACE IT, MICROSOFT WILL REFUND THE AMOUNT SHOWN ON YOUR RECEIPT FOR THE SOFTWARE. IT WILL ALSO REPAIR OR REPLACE SUPPLEMENTS, UPDATES AND REPLACEMENT SOFTWARE AT NO CHARGE. IF MICROSOFT CANNOT REPAIR OR REPLACE THEM, IT WILL REFUND THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THEM, IF ANY. YOU MUST UNINSTALL THE SOFTWARE AND RETURN ANY MEDIA AND OTHER ASSOCIATED MATERIALS TO MICROSOFT WITH PROOF OF PURCHASE TO OBTAIN A REFUND. THESE ARE YOUR ONLY REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY.

    CONSUMER RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED.  YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE.

    WARRANTY PROCEDURES.  You need proof of purchase for warranty service.

        United States and Canada. For warranty service or information about how to obtain a refund for software acquired in the United States and Canada, contact Microsoft at

            (800) MICROSOFT;

            Microsoft Customer Service and Support, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399; or

            visit www.microsoft.com/info/nareturns.htm.

        Europe, Middle East and Africa. If you acquired the software in Europe, the Middle East or Africa, Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited makes this limited warranty. To make a claim under this warranty, you should contact either

            Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, Customer Care Centre, Atrium Building Block B, Carmanhall Road, Sandyford Industrial Estate, Dublin 18, Ireland; or

            the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (see www.microsoft.com/worldwide).

        Outside United States, Canada, Europe, Middle East and Africa. If you acquired the software outside the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (see www.microsoft.com/worldwide).

    NO OTHER WARRANTIES.  THE LIMITED WARRANTY IS THE ONLY DIRECT WARRANTY FROM MICROSOFT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. WHERE ALLOWED BY YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. If your local laws give you any implied warranties, guarantees or conditions, despite this exclusion, your remedies are described in the Remedy for Breach of Warranty clause above, to the extent permitted by your local laws.

    LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY.  THE LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES CLAUSE ABOVE APPLIES TO BREACHES OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY.

A. GARANTIE LIMITÉE. Si vous suivez les instructions, le logiciel fonctionnera dans son ensemble comme il est décrit dans la documentation de Microsoft reçue avec ou dans le logiciel.

B. DURÉE DE LA GARANTIE ; BÉNÉFICIAIRE DE LA GARANTIE ; DURÉE DE TOUTE GARANTIE IMPLICITE. La garantie limitée couvre le logiciel pendant un an après son acquisition par le premier utilisateur. Si vous recevez des compléments, des mises à jour ou un logiciel de remplacement au cours de cette année, ils seront couverts par la garantie pendant la durée restante ou pendant 30 jours, la période la plus longue étant retenue. Si le premier utilisateur transfère le logiciel, la durée restante de la garantie s’applique au destinataire.

Dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur, toute garantie ou condition implicite dont vous bénéficiez prendra fin au terme de la garantie limitée. Certains États n’autorisent pas les limitations portant sur la durée d’une garantie implicite, de sorte que les limitations ci-dessus peuvent ne pas vous être applicables. Elles peuvent également ne pas vous être applicables, car certains pays n’autorisent pas les limitations portant sur la durée d’une garantie ou condition implicite.

C. EXCLUSIONS DE LA GARANTIE. Cette garantie ne couvre pas les problèmes engendrés par vos propres actes (ou absences d’actes), ceux de tiers ou tout autre événement indépendant de la volonté de Microsoft.

Ces recours sont les seuls dont vous disposez dans le cadre de la violation de garantie limitée.

E. DROITS DES CONSOMMATEURS NON AFFECTÉS. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits des consommateurs supplémentaires dans le cadre du droit local, que ce contrat ne peut modifier.

F. PROCÉDURES RELATIVES AUX RÉCLAMATIONS DANS LE CADRE DE LA GARANTIE. Vous devrez fournir une preuve d’achat pour obtenir de l’aide en matière de garantie.
